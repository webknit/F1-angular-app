# F1 Angular App

This was one of the first Angular apps I made. I started with this tutorial (http://www.toptal.com/angular-js/a-step-by-step-guide-to-your-first-angularjs-app) and went on to implement some additional features myself.

## Getting Started

Once checked out you need to 

	npm install

Run the application

	npm start

App can be accessed at 

	http://localhost:8000/app/
